It refers to making changes to the default configuration of a Network Device and its operating system (OS), software applications, and required third-party software to limit security vulnerabilities. Removal of unnecessary services and programs is an aspect of system hardening that refers to removal of unnecessary services and programs commonly installed on network devices. ', N'Unused services in a host operating system that are left enabled are possible entry points for exploits on the network and are generally not monitored because these services are not used. Only the services used for control systems operation and maintenance shall be enabled to limit possible entry points.

', N'Often, networked devices ship with a variety of services enabled and default operating system programs/utilities pre-installed. These range from system diagnostics to chat programs, several of which have well-known vulnerabilities. Various attacks have been crafted to exploit these services to obtain information leading to compromise the system. 

Any program that offers a network service that “listens” on specific addresses for connection requests. On a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP) network, these addresses are a combination of IP address and TCP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports. A recommended hardening activity is simply disabling or removing any services or programs, which are not required for normal system operation, thus removing potential vulnerabilities.

Port scans are the normal method of ensuring existence of required services and absence of unneeded services. A port scan shall be run before the FAT with a representative, fully functional system configuration. All input/output (I/O) ports need to be scanned for UDP and TCP. The scan needs to be run before the FAT and again prior to the SAT. Port scans can rarely be used on production systems. In most cases, scanners will disrupt operations.

', N'Postcontract award, the Vendor shall provide documentation detailing all applications, utilities, system services, scripts, configuration files, databases, and all other software required and the appropriate configurations, including revisions and/or patch levels for each of the computer systems associated with the control system.

The Vendor shall provide a listing of services required for any computer system running control system applications or required to interface the control system applications. The listing shall include all ports and services required for normal operation as well as any other ports and services required for emergency operation. The listing shall also include an explanation or cross reference to justify why each service is necessary for operation.

The Vendor shall verify and provide documentation that all services are patched to current status.

2. The Vendor shall install Firmware updates available for the computer or network device certified by the system manufacturer at the time of installation and provide documentation.
3. The Vendor shall provide a summary table indicating each communication path required by the system. Include the following information in this table:
    1. Source device name and media access control (MAC) and/or IP address
    2. Destination device name and MAC and/or IP address
    3. Protocol (e.g., TCP and UDP) and port or range of ports.
4. The Vendor shall perform network-based validation and documentation steps on each device:
    1. Full TCP and UDP port scan on Ports 1–65535. This scanning needs to be completed during a simulated “normal system operation.”

It refers to making changes to the default configuration of a Network Device and its operating system (OS), software applications, and required third-party software to limit security vulnerabilities. Installing operating systems, applications, and third-party software updates is an aspect of system hardening that requires installation of patches and software updates, including antivirus scanners, to reduce attack surface. ', N'Most successful cyber attacks occur in nonpatched systems or applications. 

', N'As control system applications come under increased scrutiny by the hacker community, it can be expected that any vulnerabilities and exploits will become common knowledge among that community quickly, as has been shown within the IT community. Responsible system and product Vendors regularly release updates, patches, service packs, or other fixes to their products to address known and potential vulnerabilities. Of course, to be effective, these must be installed in a timely fashion.

Most common operating systems ship with a number of well-known vulnerabilities; even a new system is likely to be vulnerable based on the services that are active and because patches are not likely to be current. Therefore, an essential system hardening activity is simply installing the latest versions or updates of any necessary software loaded on a system. Of course, testing and validation of the patches and upgrades are necessary prior to performing the updates on a production system.

In many cases, Vendor support is limited to the installation of specific software releases. Therefore, updates can only be reliably applied based on the requirements of that particular software product. Patches have been known to introduce security vulnerabilities or reverse security features making it important to understand all processes (services, ports, permissions, etc.) affected by the patch.

Scanning is an effective tool to identify vulnerabilities. Use caution, however, because active scanning of live control system networks has been known to disable the networks during operations. FAT and SAT provide critical opportunities for active scanning tests without an impact to production. Even passive scanning is not recommended on production systems until the impact to operations is fully understood.

', N'Firewalls are network devices, which block selective (filter) traffic between network zones (subnets) or from a network to a device. Historically, firewalls, or simple “screening routers,” blocked traffic based on IP address and port combinations. 

Although any network device that filters traffic may be referred to as a firewall; modern usage typically assumes some advanced potentials beyond these rudimentary capabilities. These are often described as "application aware", "stateful inspection,” or other Vendor variations. These capabilities take into account not only the IP addresses and ports used in a connection, but track the address that originated a connection (allowing control of direction), state of the connection, and any number of other factors.

Although most commercial products provide only limited protection for industrial protocols, such as those commonly used in control system networks, this is changing as manufacturers respond to market demand.

Firewalls produce traffic logs that are vital for network monitoring. All traffic through the firewall needs to be logged, including outbound traffic. These logs, if effectively and efficiently designed to be used with HIDS, NIDS, application logs, etc., are essential for forensic purposes.

Coding for security is an aspect of coding practices that encourages developers to address security considerations as well as data processing during programming. ', N'Software flaws are a primary avenue for gaining system access. Many control system security vulnerabilities are the direct result of writing software with inadequate attention to defense against deliberate and persistent malicious attack. These attacks include, but are not limited to:

1. Buffer overflows, in which input fields are populated with long data sequences that overflow program buffers, often yielding program controls to the remote user (providing a useful command prompt in some cases).
2. Data insertion and injection, in which input fields are populated with control or command sequences embedded in various ways that are nevertheless accepted by the application, or possibly passed to the OS, and that allow privileged malicious and unauthorized programs to be run on the remote system.

These vulnerabilities are particularly threatening because the control system can be compromised by bypassing normal access control checks, such as firewalls—control system traffic will appear normal as far as the network is concerned.

Both of these acts of updating to the latest detection signatures and scanning the files may affect control system networks, especially those with legacy components. Manual scanning or scanning files for malware on a scheduled basis is known to use up central processing unit (CPU) resources and may impact other process executions on the host. Active scanning is the process of scanning files only when the files are accessed or modified and have been used in control systems. In-memory scans will detect the presence of malware in memory, which may affect performance of the system. Faulty signature files may impact critical control system files requiring the need for quick roll back of the signatures and restoring the suspected files. Quarantining the files provides a mechanism to perform forensics if malicious code is detected. In industry, some Vendors only provide guidance to determine which type of detection shall be used, while others provide guidance on how to configure malware scans, and still others bundle malware detectors into the system.

Updates to malware detection software may change control system behavior enough to require retesting to determine the impact to operations.

The Vendor shall also test major updates to malware detection applications and provide performance measurement data on the impact of using the malware detection applications in an active system.

INSERT [dbo].[PROCUREMENT_LANGUAGE_DATA] ([Procurement_Id], [Parent_Heading_Id], [Section_Number], [Topic_Name], [Heading], [Basis], [Language_Guidance], [Procurement_Language], [Fatmeasures], [Satmeasures], [Maintenance_Guidance], [References_Doc], [Flow_Document]) VALUES (453, 7, N'8.1', N'Network Addressing and Name Resolution', N'Host name resolution is a security principle that should be considered when designing and procuring control systems products. It is the process of resolving a host name to an internet protocol (IP) address before the source host sends the initial IP packet. Network addressing and name resolution is an aspect of host name resolution that concerns domain name system (DNS) security practices. ', N'DNS servers are susceptible to many types of cyber exploits including spoofing, cache poisoning, and denial of service (DoS) attacks. In a spoofing attack, an attacker, who has obtained DNS zone data (the name to IP address mapping), creates packets that appear to come from a valid address. The attacker can then redirect clients by appearing as the legitimate name server. Cache poisoning involves polluting the cache on the DNS server with erroneous data to redirect traffic to a server under the control of the attacker. In a DoS attack, the attacker floods the DNS server with recursive queries. Eventually, the DNS service is no longer available.

', N'To protect against DNS exploits, DNS servers for the internal control system network should reside inside the firewall and should be separate from the DNS servers on the corporate network. DNS servers for the control system network should be authoritative for the address space of the control system network only. That is, the DNS servers should contain the complete zone information (name to IP address mappings) only for hosts on the control system network. Ideally, the control system network is isolated and hosts will not need to resolve external names. However, if hosts need to resolve names for hosts outside the trusted control system network, queries should go to the control system DNS server, which will forward the queries through the firewall to a DNS server on the corporate network. 

DNS servers are typically set up as a minimum configuration in pairs for failover and reliability. A master server and a slave server make up the pair. The master server contains the original zone data, and zone transfers are made to the slave server when changes occur. As mentioned above, IP addresses can be assigned statically or dynamically. If possible, static addressing schemes should be used in control system networks. Dynamic addressing results in frequent IP address changes, and thus, frequent zone updates and transfers. Zone updates and transfers can provide a potential avenue for an attacker to modify DNS records or to gain information about the network. With dynamic addressing, the zone data on the master server are updated automatically with DHCP. With static addressing, zone data changes can be made manually by a system administrator, eliminating potential vulnerabilities associated with automatic updates. Also, the stable IP addresses associated with static addressing results in fewer zone transfers. Regardless of whether static or dynamic addressing is used, restrictions should be placed on both master and slave servers to only allow zone transfers to trusted hosts. In addition, transaction signatures should be used to authenticate zone transfers by adding cryptographic signatures.

Considerations for securely configuring DNS are summarized by:

1. Using dedicated servers for DNS and related services and disable all unneeded services.
2. Using the latest software builds with current patches.
3. Backing up and reviewing DNS configuration files periodically and running integrity checks to verify the integrity of configuration files, zone data, and other DNS files.
4. Running DNS servers as a user other than a root. Enabling access controls to allow only specific individuals to create, delete, or modify DNS data.
5. Enabling cache pollution prevention.
6. Restricting addresses that can query control system DNS servers to control system hosts.
7. Restricting zone transfers to only trusted hosts and authenticating zone transfers.
8. Using a static addressing scheme. If dynamic addressing is used, allow dynamic updates from only trusted hosts.
9. Configuring the firewall to allow communication between the control system and corporate DNS servers only on UDP and TCP Port 53.
10. Allowing special considerations for hosts with multiple IP addresses for redundancy.

A remote terminal unit (RTU) is one type of end device that is microprocessor-controlled and is used to provide system control of industrial processes. ', N'RTUs can be used as access points to other systems that perform command and control functions. The devices are used to provide system control at the lowest level of a process and are vulnerable to communication interception and modification. Hardware and software (e.g., portable configuration computers) are needed to program RTUs. RTUs and configuration computers need to be secured by physical and cyber means (see Sections 2.4, 2.6, 4.1–4.5, and 7).

A programmable logic controller (PLC) is a digital computer used to provide system control of industrial processes. PLCs are designed for multiple inputs and outputs along with a processing unit used to monitor inputs, make decisions, and control outputs.', N'Programmable logic controllers can be used as access points to other systems that perform command and control functions. PLCs communicate over open networks that are vulnerable to communication interception and modification. Hardware and software (e.g., portable configuration computers) are needed to program PLCs.

Therefore, it is necessary to verify that both the PLC itself and the communication to and from the device are secured to achieve integrity of the communication and the processing unit. It is also necessary to secure the PLC from both cyber and physical modifications.

Some newer PLCs are including embedded operating systems that have many common operating system components (e.g., Linux). These embedded operating systems need to be hardened (see Section  REF _Ref226868111 \r \h 2).

SISs frequently run on PLC architectures. These systems are the last line of automated protection for critical processes that could result in severe damage or fatalities if compromised. Industry certifications are common for SIS. Legacy SIS/PLCs run on separate architectures from control functions.

If the communication from the input device (e.g., sensor) to the PLC or from the PLC to the output device (e.g., controller) or the network is intercepted and modified, the controlled process could be adversely affected. In addition, the processing unit within the PLC is susceptible to modification thus affecting the control functions. Therefore, it is necessary to verify that both the PLC itself and the communication to and from the device are secured to achieve integrity of the communication and the processing unit. It is also necessary to secure the PLC from both cyber and physical modifications.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12" xml:space="preserve">Some newer PLCs are including embedded operating systems that have many common operating system components (e.g., Linux).

These systems are the last line of automated protection for critical processes that could result in severe damage or fatalities if compromised. Industry certifications are common for SIS.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. A dial-up modem is one form of remote access that allows remote access to control system equipment usually through a telephone system. ', N'Modems, often considered part of the telephone system and not the control network, are vulnerable and easily overlooked. Modem lines connected to the network or control system equipment that are left enabled are possible “back door” entry points for exploits on the network or directly on the control system equipment.

Dial-up modems connected through the public-switched telephone network (PSTN), as opposed to dedicated-line modems, are accessible to anyone in the world with a modem and are easy to discover via war dialing. 

', N'Control system equipment is installed with modems enabled. Properly implementing modem security settings (telephony firewalls and authentication, automated log monitoring, disabling power and phone lines, dial-back modem features, caller ID authentication) mitigates modem vulnerabilities. It is common to find little or no security protection for modem connections. Often, the only protection is provided by the control system devices. These devices may require a password or user ID/password combination, but even this simple protection may not be offered, especially for older legacy equipment. Throughput, latency, and bandwidth must be investigated when considering security methods.

Modem security settings may exist on the company private branch exchange (PBX). Many security settings can limit the time of day a phone line is active. Others may provide active logging capabilities that can be used in an IDS for modem connections. 

Telephony firewalls can provide voice-level capabilities similar to the data-level capabilities of network firewalls in use today. The devices are normally placed between the PSTN and the modem. 

Telephony authentication uses hardware keys on the PSTN side of the modem; when two modems attempt to connect, the master key must validate the slave key before a PSTN connection is allowed. However, if a slave key was compromised and not removed from the valid key list, an unauthorized user could obtain access. 

Automated monitoring of modem and control device connection logs can allow the system to alarm on unexpected activities. 

One simple approach to modem security is only connecting the modem power or phone line when needed (e.g., power outlet timer). Another option to limit phone line connectivity is using PBX timewindow programming.

Configuring modems to dial back instead of auto-answer can provide another layer of authentication security. Unfortunately, hackers have developed “dial-back spoofing” methods where a fake dial tone is fed to the modem allowing the hacker to maintain the connection and ignore the dial-back process. 

Caller ID can be combined with modems to allow or deny access based on comparison to a preprogrammed list of valid phone numbers. Caller ID is typically used to block war dialing efforts. Attackers have found ways to spoof a caller ID number to indicate a false number, but a correct number on the list would first need to be discovered.

Using authentication allows both modems to confirm connection to an authorized party. Many of these components, such as RTUs, PLCs, and IEDs may not require any authentication for connection. Modems can be purchased with embedded keys, or hardware keys can be added to existing modems.

Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks use clear-text protocols to inject the attacker into the communication stream to read user IDs and passwords and/or change the intercepted data before forwarding it. The MitM attack could originate within the public telephone system, the internal PBX system, or through a Voice over IP communication path. In-line encryption (bump-in-the-wire) devices can act as an intermediary between the serial port and the modem, helping mitigate this vulnerability.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. A dial-up modem is one form of remote access that allows remote access to control system equipment usually through a telephone system.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Basis</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Modems, often considered part of the telephone system and not the control network, are vulnerable and easily overlooked. Modem lines connected to the network or control system equipment that are left enabled are possible “back door” entry points for exploits on the network or directly on the control system equipment.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Dial-up modems connected through the public-switched telephone network (PSTN), as opposed to dedicated-line modems, are accessible to anyone in the world with a modem and are easy to discover via war dialing.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Language Guidance</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Control system equipment is installed with modems enabled. Properly implementing modem security settings (telephony firewalls and authentication, automated log monitoring, disabling power and phone lines, dial-back modem features, caller ID authentication) mitigates modem vulnerabilities. It is common to find little or no security protection for modem connections. Often, the only protection is provided by the control system devices. These devices may require a password or user ID/password combination, but even this simple protection may not be offered, especially for older legacy equipment. Throughput, latency, and bandwidth must be investigated when considering security methods.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Modem security settings may exist on the company private branch exchange (PBX). Many security settings can limit the time of day a phone line is active. Others may provide active logging capabilities that can be used in an IDS for modem connections.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Telephony firewalls can provide voice-level capabilities similar to the data-level capabilities of network firewalls in use today. The devices are normally placed between the PSTN and the modem.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Telephony authentication uses hardware keys on the PSTN side of the modem; when two modems attempt to connect, the master key must validate the slave key before a PSTN connection is allowed. However, if a slave key was compromised and not removed from the valid key list, an unauthorized user could obtain access.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Automated monitoring of modem and control device connection logs can allow the system to alarm on unexpected activities.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">One simple approach to modem security is only connecting the modem power or phone line when needed (e.g., power outlet timer). Another option to limit phone line connectivity is using PBX timewindow programming.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Configuring modems to dial back instead of auto-answer can provide another layer of authentication security. Unfortunately, hackers have developed “dial-back spoofing” methods where a fake dial tone is fed to the modem allowing the hacker to maintain the connection and ignore the dial-back process.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Caller ID can be combined with modems to allow or deny access based on comparison to a preprogrammed list of valid phone numbers. Caller ID is typically used to block war dialing efforts. Attackers have found ways to spoof a caller ID number to indicate a false number, but a correct number on the list would first need to be discovered.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Using authentication allows both modems to confirm connection to an authorized party.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. The transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) is a remote access protocol. The TCP/IP protocol stack is the foundation of communication on the Internet and most commercial networks. ', N'Poor TCP/IP implementations and/or implementations that do not fully comply with TCP/IP Requests for Comments (RFCs) can result in protocol stacks that contain vulnerabilities. Buffer overflows, the inability to handle packet fragmentation, or malformed network traffic are common problems. Intentional or accidental exploitation of vulnerabilities can lead to a device/function being compromised/targeted or can produce a DoS.

', N'The TCP/IP specifications lack basic security mechanisms resulting in fully compliant implementations remaining vulnerable to attacks (e.g., DoS, IP spoofing, session hijacking, and syn flooding). At this time, within the TCP/IP framework external mitigations are required (e.g., encryption, authentication, proper network partitioning, and correct firewall configuration). A good software security solution is IP Security (IPsec), which provides the ability to authenticate and encrypt IP traffic within the protocol stack. 

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) will not work with encrypted data. In order to use encryption and IDSs in a control system, it is necessary to place an IDS on a device that can decrypt the traffic, analyze it, and then re-encrypt it before forwarding it.

There are currently two IP standards: IPv4 and IPv6. Most network devices comply with IPv4 specifications; however, many newer devices are compatible with both IPv4 and IPv6.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. A web-based interface is a form of remote access that accepts input and provides output by generating web pages, which are transmitted via the Internet and viewed by the user using a web browser program. ', N'Web-based interfaces to control systems are gaining popularity and are often poorly designed and configured, making these interfaces vulnerable to exploits. 

', N'Web applications are often vulnerable to injection attacks of several varieties including command injection, Remote File Include (RFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Web applications with a database back-end commonly mishandle Structured Query Language (SQL) statements as well, allowing SQL injection. In addition, the HTTP servers on which these applications are hosted can be vulnerable to buffer overflows or other memory corruption attacks. Another common mistake in Web applications is directory traversal, which allows attackers access to more files than the programmer intended. Web applications in embedded devices are often written in a low-level language like C and are potentially vulnerable to buffer overflows.

Other non-HTTP services also are commonly included (e.g., FTP, TELNET) on devices, and the combination of these services can lead to greater information disclosure or other attacks. 

Authentication. Web interfaces typically contain a large amount of configuration and site-specific information. Therefore, authentication is essential to prevent an attacker from gaining more knowledge about the system. Poorly implemented interfaces using default passwords can completely undermine the security provided by authentication. Authentication can also be circumvented by SQL injection and XSS flaws, allowing an attacker to gain database access that can lead to database corruption or a full compromise of the host or device.

RFI. Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerabilities are only present, except in rare circumstances, in applications written in the PHP (hypertext preprocessor) scripting language. When an RFI attack is successful, it results in the attacker running arbitrary PHP scripts on the Web server; this is usually equivalent to full-host compromise.

Input Validation. String input validation is needed to prevent command injection, which can lead to complete host compromise. Like SQL injection, command injection can be accomplished by inputting characters that the application treats specially. The specific characters used will depend on the target system, but commonly include those in the following (nonexhaustive) list: $ % ! ` ; '' " \. Flaws of this nature are usually easy to find, are relatively simple, and provide access to an attacker as the user running the HTTP server. When combined, these factors make command injection a dangerous vulnerability that must be addressed.

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). There are two basic types of XSS: reflected and persistent. In a reflected XSS vulnerability, the attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious Web site or click on a malicious link. The persistent variety, in which the exploit is stored on the target server itself, is less common but more likely to succeed in a control system environment because using the Web application is sufficient to trigger the exploit. Regardless of how XSS is launched, it works by running JavaScript on the user’s browser in the context of the target Web page. This allows an attacker to steal the user’s cookies, thereby gaining access as that user.

Like other types of software, Web applications need to be designed and developed with security in mind.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. A web-based interface is a form of remote access that accepts input and provides output by generating web pages, which are transmitted via the Internet and viewed by the user using a web browser program.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Basis</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Web-based interfaces to control systems are gaining popularity and are often poorly designed and configured, making these interfaces vulnerable to exploits.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Language Guidance</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Web applications are often vulnerable to injection attacks of several varieties including command injection, Remote File Include (RFI) and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Web applications with a database back-end commonly mishandle Structured Query Language (SQL) statements as well, allowing SQL injection. In addition, the HTTP servers on which these applications are hosted can be vulnerable to buffer overflows or other memory corruption attacks. Another common mistake in Web applications is directory traversal, which allows attackers access to more files than the programmer intended. Web applications in embedded devices are often written in a low-level language like C and are potentially vulnerable to buffer overflows.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Other non-HTTP services also are commonly included (e.g., FTP, TELNET) on devices, and the combination of these services can lead to greater information disclosure or other attacks.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Authentication. Web interfaces typically contain a large amount of configuration and site-specific information. Therefore, authentication is essential to prevent an attacker from gaining more knowledge about the system. Poorly implemented interfaces using default passwords can completely undermine the security provided by authentication. Authentication can also be circumvented by SQL injection and XSS flaws, allowing an attacker to gain database access that can lead to database corruption or a full compromise of the host or device.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">RFI. Remote File Include (RFI) vulnerabilities are only present, except in rare circumstances, in applications written in the PHP (hypertext preprocessor) scripting language. When an RFI attack is successful, it results in the attacker running arbitrary PHP scripts on the Web server; this is usually equivalent to full-host compromise.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Input Validation. String input validation is needed to prevent command injection, which can lead to complete host compromise. Like SQL injection, command injection can be accomplished by inputting characters that the application treats specially. The specific characters used will depend on the target system, but commonly include those in the following (nonexhaustive) list: $ % ! ` ; '' " . Flaws of this nature are usually easy to find, are relatively simple, and provide access to an attacker as the user running the HTTP server. When combined, these factors make command injection a dangerous vulnerability that must be addressed.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). There are two basic types of XSS: reflected and persistent. In a reflected XSS vulnerability, the attacker must convince a user to visit a malicious Web site or click on a malicious link. The persistent variety, in which the exploit is stored on the target server itself, is less common but more likely to succeed in a control system environment because using the Web application is sufficient to trigger the exploit. Regardless of how XSS is launched, it works by running JavaScript on the user’s browser in the context of the target Web page. This allows an attacker to steal the user’s cookies, thereby gaining access as that user.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Like other types of software, Web applications need to be designed and developed with security in mind.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Procurement Language</Paragraph><Section Style="{DynamicResource SectionBackgroundFlowDocument}"><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide physical and cyber security features including, but not limited to, authentication, encryption, access control, event and communication logging, monitoring, and alarming to protect the system from unauthorized modification or use.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall clearly identify the physical and cyber security features and provide the methodologyies for maintaining the features including the methods to change settings from the Vendorconfigured or manufacturer default conditions.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall verify that the addition of security features does not adversely affect connectivity, latency, bandwidth, response time, and throughput, including during the SAT when connected to existing equipment.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall remove or disable all software components and services that are not required for the operation and maintenance of the devices that run an HTTP server prior to the FAT.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. A secure virtual private network (VPN) is a form of remote access that allows for secure or trusted communications over an unsecured or untrusted infrastructure, such as the Internet, by encrypted tunneling of traffic through the untrusted network. ', N'The primary vulnerability of any VPNs is the end-points. If one end-point is compromised, then the entire VPN is potentially compromised.

', N'The main components that make a VPN secure are encrypted traffic and protected authentication mechanism. The authentication method used can be security token, known key, securely distributed certificate, password, or combination of any of these methods. Once the authentication is complete, the VPN should encrypt all traffic between end-points to ensure no data are leaked and prevent MitM attacks. Multifactor identification and authentication is strongly advised to neutralize the effectiveness of bruteforce attacks. A common multifactor identification is a combination of a security token, known key, or certificate and a password, PIN, or biometrics.

When using any statically assigned authentication value such as password, PIN, certificate, etc., the value must never be communicated in plain text through an untrusted network.

With the addition of encryption comes the reduction in ability to monitor communications. Some installations need to be able to monitor all communications to and from the installation site. When encrypting the VPN communication, the standard firewall and IDS may not be able to inspect the contents of the VPN communication. Most VPNs can have monitoring software installed on the server or an end-point to record the pre-encrypted traffic.

Additional security measures may be necessary when partitioning a network that contains a VPN server. As such, VPN server placement and ownership should be agreed upon for each VPN that is being deployed. A good solution is to place the VPN server in a DMZ separate from the control network and allow a user on it to connect onto the control network using the authentication process required for a user who is accessing the network locally.

VPNs are strongly affected by firewall rules and as such should be considered when requesting firewall solutions. The form of VPN affects the ability to filter traffic on the firewall. VPNs that are created on Layer 3, like IPSec, can only be filter-based on IP addresses, protocol number, and entropy. VPNs that are created on Layer 4, like those based on SSL, can be filter on the aforementioned properties plus port numbers and additional TCP/UDP properties. The actual filtering effectiveness may not improve with additional properties; however, the ability to route traffic through Network Address Table (NAT) firewalls usually improves with additional properties.

It refers to the ability to connect to a computer or network from a different location via modem, Ethernet, serial, or wireless. Serial communications security is an aspect of remote access that concerns security of the transmission of information one bit at a time over a single line or a data path that is 1 bit wide.', N'Researchers have demonstrated that the protocols used in serial communications can be exploited to gain control of network devices. These devices can then be leveraged by an attacker to gain further control of the network. 

', N'When a vulnerability is found in one of these protocols (usually over Ethernet) it is often overlooked in the serial realm. Mitigation strategies must be employed to prevent exploitations from occurring within the serial domain. These mitigation strategies often involve patching applications supporting the protocol or the protocol itself. Field communication devices (e.g., front-end processor [FEP], data acquisition processor, protocol converter, or data concentrator) are often interconnected, which can provide an attacker with greater access to the control system after a compromise has occurred. 

Because of the legacy issues with serial protocols, the protocols are commonly excluded in cyber security standards. Vulnerable end-point protocols create a larger attack surface due to the distribution of serial devices over a large geographic area.

Link encryptors are used to protect field communications (e.g., bump-in-the-wire devices).

It refers to dividing a networked system into multiple segments to facilitate better security controls. Network devices is an aspect of network partitioning that requires rigorous patch management. Such devices include routers, hubs, network concentrators, and switches. ', N'The devices used to create, interconnect, segregate, protect, and isolate networks have operating systems (e.g., embedded operating system) and applications (e.g., port security, address blocking) that are susceptible to the same vulnerabilities and exploits found in most computer-based devices. Once deployed and functioning, if patch management for these devices is not rigorous, the devices will be left vulnerable to new exploits.

', N'Routers are network devices designed to direct network traffic between devices on separate networks. These devices have two or more routing interfaces and may connect to separate dedicated telecommunication equipment. Routers may implement additional capabilities such as ACL, port mirroring (e.g., span port), and some firewall functions. Advanced routers are able to operate in a failover or redundant configuration with another router to prevent communication failure. Routers include a method of interface configuration via a connected network or separate console port. These devices also contain an embedded operating system, which is held in nonvolatile firmware. Upgrades to the firmware may be performed over a network or a directly connected port. Vulnerabilities have been found in the embedded operating systems for routers requiring the need for updates. Exploits on the operating systems (e.g., resetting routers) have also been performed. ACLs are commonly used with routers for a layer of security. For a high-security network, a whitelist ACL is recommended.

Hubs or network concentrators are network devices that direct network traffic to all other devices connected within a network. These devices duplicate each received network packet and repeat it to every device connected to the hub. Hubs allow one connected device to communicate at a time. Multiple transmissions from several hosts can cause collisions that are detected by the hub. Most small hubs do not contain configuration information or firmware that can be upgraded by the end user. Advanced hubs allow management and firmware upgrades through a connected network or console port. Hubs are commonly used for multiple taps into a network (e.g., running two IDSs).

Switches are network devices that direct network traffic to other connected devices within a network. Switches have different switching speeds including 10, 100, 1000, or 10000 megabits per second (Mbps). Switches can have multiple media connections such as copper for lower bandwidth connections and fiber for high bandwidth connections. Switches can be managed or unmanaged. Unmanaged or “dumb” switches inspect received data packets, determine the destination device of that packet, and forward it to the appropriate port (i.e., L2 switches). Managed switches offer features such as virtual LAN (VLAN) segments, link aggregation, port mirroring, and other advanced networking capabilities (i.e., L3 switches). VLAN network segments implement the IEEE 802.1Q protocol for moving data between layer two networks. This allows hosts to be connected to different switches, but communicate as if the hosts share a common switch. Link aggregation or “trunking” refers to a method of moving multiple VLAN segments between switches or routers. This allows a single physical connection to carry multiple virtual network segments between devices. Port mirroring is a method by which data from one or many different switch ports is “mirrored” onto another port for monitoring and debugging. IDSs, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPSs), and network analyzers are normally connected to these ports. Managed switches can be controlled from a connected network port, separate console port, or an embedded Web-based interface. Managed switches contain an embedded operating system that is upgradeable via the configuration vectors. The embedded operating systems on switches are vulnerable to exploits that may allow access to a connected system or resetting of the switch. Port security can be enabled on switches when one MAC address is uniquely configured to one network port. This provides a layer of security for rogue devices being plugged into the switch.

Network security devices include firewalls, IDS, IPS, and VPN concentrators. These devices are used to segment and protect networks. 

Firewalls are network security devices used to separate and control traffic between two or more networks or devices. These devices include features such as packet filtering, stateful packet inspection, and traffic flooding protection. Firewalls differ from routers in that firewalls are optimized to look inside packets for specific content, whereas router ACLs only look at packet headers to determine if a packet is filtered or not. A high security network firewall would have a “deny all” rule set. Firewall rule sets are frequently over complicated. Keeping network segments small, simple, and current aids in the firewall rule complexity issues. Firewalls generate logs that need to be reviewed to verify the firewall is working properly and no new unfiltered traffic exists (see Section  REF _Ref204571646 \r \h 3.1).

NIDSs are security devices that monitor traffic on a network segment or multiple segments. IDS appliances use signatures and anomaly-based intelligence to determine unauthorized or abnormal traffic activities on a network segment to generate alerts. NIDSs are commonly used in conjunction with a firewall to verify the proper function of the firewall. NIDSs produce logs of packet traffic that need to be reviewed for identifying unexpected packets (see Section  REF _Ref204507890 \r \h 3.2).

Network intrusion prevention systems (NIPSs) are security devices that monitor traffic on a network segment or multiple segments and use signatures and anomaly-based intelligence to block unauthorized or abnormal traffic. IPS appliances are usually configured inline with a network connection to actively block traffic in contrast to an IDS that passively monitors and alerts on traffic. Reporting by exception communication method is common for many control systems. Anomaly-based NIPSs are rarely used since these would block traffic during a time when all end devices need to make a status report. 

VPN concentrators are network devices designed to securely allow local network access to remote users. These systems build an encrypted tunnel between a local network and a remote host after a secure authentication or secure key exchange process. VPN concentrators are the preferred secure method for allowing remote users access to local network resources. Because firewalls and IDS cannot inspect encrypted packets, exploit code can be sent through an encrypted tunnel without detection. ACL routers can verify IP header information only on encrypted packets (see Section  REF _Ref204571878 \r \h 10.6).

It refers to dividing a networked system in to multiple segments to facilitate better security controls. Network architecture is an aspect of network partitioning and deals with how a network is designed and segmented into logical smaller functional subnetworks or subnets.', N'Poorly designed network architectures are vulnerable to exploits.

', N'Subnets are small functional groupings of network-attached devices usually connected to the same switch or group of switches. Subnets can contain any number of devices up to 16,777,214. Subnets are classified as Class A, B, or C depending on the size of the IP address space and netmask. Private, nonInternet routable addresses are usually assigned to devices without direct accessibility from the Internet. Private nonroutable addresses are defined as 10.X.X.X, 172.16.X.X, and 192.168.X.X by the Internet Assigned Number Authority.

A demilitarized zone (DMZ) is a separate network subnet designed to expose specific services to a larger, untrusted network. The subnets are used in large corporations to safely expose functions to the Internet, such as Web or database applications. DMZs also are used internal to networks to facilitate secure data transfer from a high security network zone to a zone with lower security. A DMZ uses explicit access control and contains computer hosts that provide network services to both low and high-security network zones. DMZ networks are usually implemented with a firewall or other traffic routing network device. It can be split into several sub-DMZ networks with specific functional groupings for the computers such as Web servers, timeservers, or FTP repositories.

Secure network architectures contain a combination of network segmentation, traffic control, and traffic monitoring. Segmentation is used to separate functional sets of network hosts into groupings. Traffic control is implemented with routers and firewalls to prevent unauthorized access between different subnets. Traffic monitoring validates what traffic is allowed and alerts when unauthorized traffic is detected.

When segmenting a network, devices associated with a heightened security profile should be grouped together and separated from devices with a lower security profile. An example would be a corporate network with tens or hundreds of normal users separated from a server cluster or network that needs maximum uptime. Data that need to be moved between zones with different security levels should pass through a third network segment known as a DMZ. The DMZ should be considered to have the lowest security profile. Network devices hosted in a DMZ should replicate data between the higher security networks. The DMZ network collectively should consist of several functional DMZ networks with groupings of network hosts providing similar services. Segmentation is accomplished with firewalls and routers. Segments requiring heightened security should be segmented using a firewall to prevent unauthorized traffic between segments. 

Traffic control between security zones should be employed with a firewall and use a “default deny” access policy. This requires all traffic to be dropped unless explicitly allowed with firewall rules. Network traffic should be specified by source and destination IP address and network port at a minimum. Data from a DMZ should be replicated over a minimum number of secure protocols.

Traffic monitoring of security zones should be performed inside each logical network segment at the minimum. For a more robust monitoring solution, both sides of a firewall or router can be monitored as a way to verify ACLs or firewall filtering rules. DMZ network segments should have an IDS dedicated to the segment. DMZ IDS logs should be checked often and validated against traffic in and out of the network. Traffic monitoring inside a static network environment should use whitelisting, port security, and canaries to enhance security (e.g., DMZ).

Secure control system segmentation should be implemented from the inside out. The control network is the highest security profile and requires the maximum uptime. A firewall should separate the control system from all other networks. If data from the control system is needed by another network, data should be replicated to DMZ in a secure manner such as secure FTP or secure copy. Data allowed though the firewall should be heavily restricted and only allow the minimum number of open ports and hosts to be available.

Network simplification should be a priority when designing initial architecture or firewall rules. The variety of protocols open for data should be kept to a minimum. Data that are modified multiple times and retransmitted such as database, Web, and FTP, should be moved to the DMZ first, modified in the DMZ, and transmitted from the DMZ to other networks.

It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. Bluetooth technology is a short-range, wireless communications technology that can simultaneously handle both data and voice transmissions. ', N'Bluetooth is designed as a cable replacement and personal area networking technology that allows freedom in placing devices without concern for running cables. Bluetooth broadcasts in the ISM band at 2.4 to 2.485 GHz, similar to other devices such as microwave ovens and cordless telephones. ISM is a license-free frequency band. Wireless technologies all have a common security risk in that anyone in the broadcasting area can intercept the transmission. Bluetooth-enabled devices have additional security risks, in that these provide a gateway to larger networks and other devices not using Bluetooth. Like other wireless technologies, security is provided using encryption, authentication, and configuration control.

', N'Bluetooth wireless technology is a short-range communications technology intended to replace the cables connecting portable and/or fixed devices and providing a method for connecting unrelated wireless and wired devices. The Bluetooth specification defines a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other. However, the implementation of the Bluetooth specification may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer; i.e., all Bluetooth implementations are not the same.

Bluetooth-enabled electronic devices connect and communicate wirelessly through short-range networks. It uses a frequency hopping spread spectrum technology to minimize the possibility of interference in the ISM band and encryption at the link or application levels to provide confidentiality and integrity for the transmitted data. Each device can simultaneously communicate with up to seven other devices within a single network. Line-of-sight (LoS) is not required. Most Bluetooth-enabled devices use omni-directional antennas for the communication, eliminating orientation issues. Each device can belong to several networks simultaneously. 

A complete Bluetooth application requires a Bluetooth controller (hardware device) that typically connects to a host computer through a USB port, and additional services and higher-level protocols, known as the Bluetooth host, that are installed as software on the same host computer. Without proper configuration, Bluetooth can allow any other Bluetooth device within radio proximity to access the system. 

Security for a Bluetooth network is implemented through the frequency band hops, authentication, and encryption. The frequency hopping makes it difficult to eavesdrop. User authentication controls access to the network. The encryption provided is implemented using custom algorithms based on the SAFER+ block cipher and is secured at the 1, 40, and 64 bit levels.

', N'In industrial plants, WCCTV systems may be used to observe parts of a process that are remote from a control room, or where the environment is not comfortable for humans. WCCTV systems also are used for intelligence gathering, in contaminated environments, and for training purposes.

A WCCTV system is less dependent on the environment and infrastructure. It can be installed and moved with less difficulty, giving it an advantage in temporary or short-term applications.

The video may be transmitted using wireless technology in combination with the IP, rather than transmission over traditional analog frequencies. A typical IP video network includes both fixed and pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras (either IP cameras or analog cameras attached to IP encoders), network video recorders (NVR) and viewing platforms. The use of video, in combination with data and voice, has a tremendous impact on network design and performance because of bandwidth, latency, and jitter requirements. The bandwidth necessary for the network varies based on the resolution, frames per second (fps) desired and codec used, as well as the motion content of the video.

It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. Radio frequency identification (RFID) describes the use of radio frequency signals to provide automatic identification and tracking of items by remotely receiving information stored in a tag on the object. ', N'Radio frequency identification (RFID) describes the use of radio frequency signals to provide automatic identification and tracking of items. RFID is a method of identifying and/or tracking an item (equipment, device, or other physical object) by remotely receiving information stored in a tag on the object. Besides being vulnerable to common attacks such as eavesdropping, MitM, and DoS, RFID technology is, in particular, susceptible to spoof and power attacks. 

', N'RFID tags are small silicon microchips attached to an antenna, which emit information using radio waves over short distances. Miniature RFID tags can be embedded in many types of assets and scanned from between two to three meters away, depending on several factors, revealing information about the asset.

RFID tags consist of an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and demodulating the signal and an antenna or coil for receiving and transmitting the signal. 

RFID tags are normally classified as passive, active, or semipassive. Passive tags require no internal power source. They receive power to transmit the stored information from the reader. Semipassive and active tags require an internal power source, usually a small battery.

RFID systems also can be classified by frequency ranges. Low-frequency (30 kHz to 500 kHz) systems have short reading ranges and lower system costs and high-frequency (850 MHz to 950 MHz and 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz) systems, offering long read ranges (greater than 90 feet), high reading speeds, and higher system costs.

Most current RFID systems are not secure due to their primary mission, i.e., inventory of materials. In cases where they perform a secure function, such as tracking hazardous materials being used in a process, special care should be used in specifying and procuring these systems.

INSERT [dbo].[PROCUREMENT_LANGUAGE_DATA] ([Procurement_Id], [Parent_Heading_Id], [Section_Number], [Topic_Name], [Heading], [Basis], [Language_Guidance], [Procurement_Language], [Fatmeasures], [Satmeasures], [Maintenance_Guidance], [References_Doc], [Flow_Document]) VALUES (473, 12, N'13.4', N'802.11 Technology', N'Wireless is a technology that should be considered when designing and procuring control systems products. It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. 802.11 refers to a wireless specification developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for wireless local area network (WLAN) technology. ', N'The reference, 802.11, refers to a family of specifications developed by IEEE for wireless local area network (WLAN) technology. It specifies a wireless interface between a wireless device and a base station (access point) or between two wireless devices (peer to peer). 802.11 devices operate in the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz public spectrum bands. Because these transmissions are through the air, these can be intercepted or interfered with by those having the proper equipment.

', N'There is only one current 802.11 standard. It is denoted by IEEE 802.11 followed by the date that it was published. The standard is updated by means of amendments. When a wireless device is referred to as 802.11x, x is an amendment to the original 802.11 standard. As of this date, IEEE 802.11-2007 is the most current 802.11 document available and contains cumulative changes (802.11a,b,d,e,g,h,i,j) from multiple subletter task groups. Care must be exercised when defining the 802.11 standard in procurement documents to be sure of the latest version. 

The 802.11 standard, hereafter referred to as 802.11, defines the MAC and physical layers for a LAN with wireless connectivity where the connected devices are within close proximity to each other. 

The Basic Service Set is the basic component of an 802.11 wireless LAN. The Basic Service Set consists of a group of stations. The station is the basic component of the WLAN. It is any device that provides the 802.11 protocol (MAC, physical layers, and a connection to the wireless device). The station might be a personal computer, handheld device, or an access point and may be mobile or stationary. 

Security is provided by encryption, authentication, and configuration control. The encryption methods used are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WiFi Protected Access (WPA), or WPA2. WEP can be easily intercepted and decoded. Numerous free software tools exist to aid in such endeavors. Due to these weaknesses, enhanced security was introduced for Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) networks through the WPA protocol. The security of connections using this protocol depends largely on the strength of the user-supplied pass-phrase. Free software and descriptions of how to attack these connections also are available online. Improving upon previous security implementations, the WiFi Alliance released the WPA2 standard, which uses a stronger encryption algorithm.

Despite the availability of strong encryption for user communication, the management frames of IEEE 802.11 messages are not encrypted, leaving the door open for DoS attacks. Several tools are available that can cause users to drop off the network or send messages to hamper the functionality of wireless end points. Such tools include WiFi jammers, designed to block IEEE 802.11 transmissions, and rogue access points, that are set up in hopes of attracting connections then stealing sensitive information or altering communications. Adding to and enabling attacks is the fact that WiFi access points are often set up quickly and without security foresight. This results in the use of weak or no encryption, allowing attackers to impersonate wireless end points in hopes of providing false data. It also may result in users not changing default passwords for device management, allowing attackers to gain full control of the access point as default passwords are common knowledge. Recently, researchers have considered the possibility of worms that use the aforementioned security weaknesses to propagate on the local network. Such malicious code would rely on two assumptions to propagate. First, in urban settings, numerous WiFi networks exist within close proximity of one another. Second, that victim machines are configured to connect to multiple networks.

It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. 802.11 refers to a wireless specification developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) for wireless local area network (WLAN) technology.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Basis</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">The reference, 802.11, refers to a family of specifications developed by IEEE for wireless local area network (WLAN) technology. It specifies a wireless interface between a wireless device and a base station (access point) or between two wireless devices (peer to peer). 802.11 devices operate in the 5 GHz and 2.4 GHz public spectrum bands. Because these transmissions are through the air, these can be intercepted or interfered with by those having the proper equipment.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Language Guidance</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">There is only one current 802.11 standard. It is denoted by IEEE 802.11 followed by the date that it was published. The standard is updated by means of amendments. When a wireless device is referred to as 802.11x, x is an amendment to the original 802.11 standard. As of this date, IEEE 802.11-2007 is the most current 802.11 document available and contains cumulative changes (802.11a,b,d,e,g,h,i,j) from multiple subletter task groups. Care must be exercised when defining the 802.11 standard in procurement documents to be sure of the latest version.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">The 802.11 standard, hereafter referred to as 802.11, defines the MAC and physical layers for a LAN with wireless connectivity where the connected devices are within close proximity to each other.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">The Basic Service Set is the basic component of an 802.11 wireless LAN. The Basic Service Set consists of a group of stations. The station is the basic component of the WLAN. It is any device that provides the 802.11 protocol (MAC, physical layers, and a connection to the wireless device). The station might be a personal computer, handheld device, or an access point and may be mobile or stationary.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Security is provided by encryption, authentication, and configuration control. The encryption methods used are Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), WiFi Protected Access (WPA), or WPA2. WEP can be easily intercepted and decoded. Numerous free software tools exist to aid in such endeavors. Due to these weaknesses, enhanced security was introduced for Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) networks through the WPA protocol. The security of connections using this protocol depends largely on the strength of the user-supplied pass-phrase. Free software and descriptions of how to attack these connections also are available online. Improving upon previous security implementations, the WiFi Alliance released the WPA2 standard, which uses a stronger encryption algorithm.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Despite the availability of strong encryption for user communication, the management frames of IEEE 802.11 messages are not encrypted, leaving the door open for DoS attacks. Several tools are available that can cause users to drop off the network or send messages to hamper the functionality of wireless end points. Such tools include WiFi jammers, designed to block IEEE 802.11 transmissions, and rogue access points, that are set up in hopes of attracting connections then stealing sensitive information or altering communications. Adding to and enabling attacks is the fact that WiFi access points are often set up quickly and without security foresight. This results in the use of weak or no encryption, allowing attackers to impersonate wireless end points in hopes of providing false data. It also may result in users not changing default passwords for device management, allowing attackers to gain full control of the access point as default passwords are common knowledge. Recently, researchers have considered the possibility of worms that use the aforementioned security weaknesses to propagate on the local network. Such malicious code would rely on two assumptions to propagate. First, in urban settings, numerous WiFi networks exist within close proximity of one another. Second, that victim machines are configured to connect to multiple networks.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Procurement Language</Paragraph><Section Style="{DynamicResource SectionBackgroundFlowDocument}"><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide the WiFi device, meeting the requirements of the required sections of IEEE 802.11, and associated documentation.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">Postcontract award, the Vendor shall provide detailed information on communications (including protocols) required for the WiFi device to communicate with the control network and the types of network devices with which the WiFi device can communicate.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide documentation on the range of the WiFi device, power requirements, and the designated frequencies of operation for each device.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall allow and recommend alarm settings in accordance to the needs of the system.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall define interoperability limits for the WiFi device specifically stating the devices that could be replaced and any associated problems that might be associated with the replacement.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide, within a prenegotiated period, any test data associated with the WiFi device.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The WiFi device shall be provided with security devices, such as passwords or security codes, to protect the device from unauthorized modification or use.

', N'Wireless Highway Addressable Remote Transducer (HART) is a Wireless Mesh Network Communications Protocol designed to meet the needs of process automation applications. WirelessHART is a key part of the HART Field Communications Protocol Revision 7 and is backward compatible with existing HART devices and applications. The WirelessHART standard was approved on June 2007 and was released in September 2007.

WirelessHART is in the early stages of development and deployment; hence, there is not much publicly available information regarding its security. It shall be noted that because the IEEE 802.15.4 protocol is the basis for this technology, the previous IEEE 802.15.4 security analysis is applicable. WirelessHART like all wireless technologies is subject to the same security issues because of over the air transmission of data.

', N'The architecture of WirelessHART also supports field devices, gateways, and a network manager. There is a considerable similarity between this standard and the Zigbee standard. Since the creation of the WirelessHart convergence committee in Industrial Standards Automation (ISA)100, WirelessHART will likely merge into ISA100. WirelessHART operates in the 2.4 GHz ISM band.

WirelessHART uses IEEE 802.15.4-2006 compatible physical and MAC Layer. Additionally, it supports hybrid Frequency Hopping SS and Direct Sequence SS. Securing communications is done with AES-128 block ciphers with individual Join and Session Keys and Data-Link Level Network Key. A primary objective of the WirelessHART standard is to be directly compatible with existing HART-enabled equipment, applications, and tools.

', N'The Vendor shall provide, within a prenegotiated period, any test data associated with the WirelessHART devices.

The WirelessHART device shall be provided with security devices, such as passwords or security codes, to protect the device from unauthorized modification or use. The Vendor shall clearly identify these security devices and methods to change them from the Vendor-configured or manufacture default conditions. 

The Vendor shall provide the WirelessHART device with the standard security measures as specified in the WirelessHART standard.

The Vendor shall remove or disable all software artifacts that are not required for the operation and maintenance of the device prior to the FAT.

The Vendor shall provide the Purchaser SAT procedures that include exercising all functionality and calibration procedures.

The Vendor shall document the equipment configuration and specifically note any security measures associated with the system (encryption devices, password protection, etc.).

', N'The FAT shall be performed per written procedures agreed upon by the Purchaser and in agreement with the requirements of the WirelessHART specification.

It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. Mobile radios are used primarily for voice communication on radio frequencies. ', N'Mobile radios refer to wireless communications systems and devices that transmit and receive information, primarily voice, on radio frequencies. The transmitter and/or the receiver are mobile. Because these devices transmit wirelessly, these are subject to interception and modification of the signals.

', N'Mobile radios include walkie-talkies, Citizen Band (CB) radios, two-way radios, hand-held two-way radios, radio telephones, and mobile data transmittal devices. A modern mobile radio consists of a radio transceiver, housed in a single box, and a microphone with a push-to-talk release-to-listen button. A mobile radio must have an associated antenna. Other features of mobile radio systems may include: point-to-multipoint communications, large coverage areas, closed user groups, and use of Very High Frequency (VHF) or Ultra High Frequency (UHF) bands.

Since these mobile radios are used primarily for voice communication, for this document mobile data transmittal devices or devices used to transmit sensitive voice communication are of primary concern. Those devices used for day-to-day voice communication are normally off-the-shelf and include no security devices, such as walkie-talkies and CB radios.

Different types of radio service for mobile radios include Land Mobile Radio and General Mobile Radio Service (GMRS). Land Mobile Radio is a field radio communications system that uses portable, mobile, base station, and dispatch console radios typically used by police forces and fire brigades. Land Mobile Radio devices may be based on such standards as Mobile Professional Mobile Radio (PMR) Trunk (MPT)-1327, TETRA and APCO 25. GMRS is a licensed land-mobile FM UHF radio service available for short-distance two-way communication, similar to Family Radio Service radios. GMRS is an improved walkie-talkie system that shares some frequencies (Channels 1–7) with Family Radio Service. GMRS radios may be portable, mobile, and base station-style.

Mobile radio Vendors are now offering IP-based mobile radio products. As mobile radios move into the IP-based digital domain, these products become susceptible to the same communications vulnerabilities as IP-based computer communications. This evolution, however, given the open network environment, introduces new security threats. 

The following sections pertain only to those systems that transmit/receive sensitive information of control data. These shall not be used for the procurement or testing of off-the-shelf devices.

It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. A wireless mesh network (WMN) is one of many Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4-based technologies. ', N'A Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. In WMNs, nodes are composed of mesh routers and mesh clients. Each node operates not only as a host but also as a router, forwarding packets on behalf of other nodes that may not be within direct wireless transmission range of their destinations. 

Potential vulnerabilities exist with route management protocols, remote centralized management system, and over-the-air firmware upgrades via IP Internet traffic, WMN operating system, and applications running on any node of the wireless mesh network such as SSH (Secure Shell) daemons or lightweight Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers. Because the transmissions between WMN nodes are through the air, they can be intercepted or interfered with by those having the proper equipment.

', N'Most, if not all IEEE 802.15.4-based technologies are WMNs. In addition to these networks, there are also other proprietary mesh network technologies. Regardless of technology, WMNs consist of the end devices or end nodes that could be a sensor or other asset. These assets are connected to the mesh network via a wireless router or repeater unit that is used to forward its data to the central host. Typically, these networks will have a special node called a gateway, which will connect the wireless network to the wire-line network. WMN integration with the Internet, cellular, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.16, sensor networks, etc., can be accomplished through gateway and bridging functions in the mesh routers. WMNs provide a method for transport of data by routing the data through adjacent routers/nodes. This provides wide coverage by multiple smaller cells using wireless nodes to route data.

In WMNs, nodes are composed of mesh routers and mesh clients. Each node operates not only as a host but also as a router, forwarding packets on behalf of other nodes that may not be within direct wireless transmission range of their destinations.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Potential vulnerabilities exist with route management protocols, remote centralized management system, and over-the-air firmware upgrades via IP Internet traffic, WMN operating system, and applications running on any node of the wireless mesh network such as SSH (Secure Shell) daemons or lightweight Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) servers. Because the transmissions between WMN nodes are through the air, they can be intercepted or interfered with by those having the proper equipment.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Language Guidance</Paragraph><Section><Paragraph FontStyle="Normal" FontSize="12">Most, if not all IEEE 802.15.4-based technologies are WMNs. In addition to these networks, there are also other proprietary mesh network technologies. Regardless of technology, WMNs consist of the end devices or end nodes that could be a sensor or other asset. These assets are connected to the mesh network via a wireless router or repeater unit that is used to forward its data to the central host. Typically, these networks will have a special node called a gateway, which will connect the wireless network to the wire-line network. WMN integration with the Internet, cellular, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.15, IEEE 802.16, sensor networks, etc., can be accomplished through gateway and bridging functions in the mesh routers. WMNs provide a method for transport of data by routing the data through adjacent routers/nodes.

It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. A cellular network is a radio network that is composed of radio cells. It is usually used for voice communication, but can be used for equipment monitoring and control. ', N'Monitoring and controlling equipment occurs at various points within an enterprise. In many cases, traditional cabled solutions or private radio networks are not a cost-effective option to cover all assets. Cellular technology may be used to manage and control industrial processes where cabling is not an option. Although the law provides penalties for the interception of cellular telephone calls, it is easily accomplished and impossible to detect. 

', N'A cellular network is a radio network that is composed of radio cells. Cellular technology is being used in SCADA environments when wide area coverage is required and the cost of alternative technologies (private radio systems, satellite, etc.) is uneconomical. Cellular is not available in some areas due to remoteness and lack of customer base.

Cellular modems are available that support both CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) EVDO (Evolution Data Only) and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) protocols. Cellular routers may incorporate a cellular modem, or allow one to connect the cellular modem to the router, and support shared Internet access with multiple Ethernet ports. Packet data may be sent over cellular networks. The “always on” nature of packet networks makes these cellular packet data networks highly suitable for monitoring and control applications.

Cellular systems have had prolific growth in the last 10 years. Cellular systems have advanced three generations and standards are complete for fourth-generation technologies providing ultra high-speed wireless data. Standards primarily originate from two different technology families, CDMA and GSM. Despite the differences in the cellular families, both have very similar architectures. The main characteristic of fourth generation technologies is that the technologies are IP based. Examples include LTE (Long Term Evolution) and Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMax).

Cellular technologies are categorized by using the term “generation” or G. Some earlier cellular technologies have had problems with security; however, 3G technologies have improved their security mechanisms significantly.

3G CDMA (EVDO) technologies include the use of 128-bit privacy and authentication keys. The Secure Hashing Algorithm-1 (SHA-1) is used for hashing and integrity with CDMA2000 networks (a hybrid 2.5G/3G network). While the AES algorithm is used for message encryption. GSM uses a similar encryption and authentication scheme known as the A5/A8 algorithm (a.k.a. A5/1, A5/2). 

Some applications of cellular technology are as a cellular bridge or as a cellular gateway. A cellular bridge is a wireless bridge that uses a public cellular network to connect a remote device to a central host. These bridges use a cellular modem to provide connectivity. The cellular bridges can connect devices to an IP network by way of the Internet, or can use e-mail alarms or short message service to transmit and receive process control information. For instance, a BlackBerry device could be used to view process variables or control valves in a location that is remote from the user.

The cellular gateway is very similar to the cellular bridge. Cellular gateways use the cellular network to bring network information to a centralized control system or host, but also provide a separate wireless network, such as an access point, to support additional wireless devices. Vendor offerings use GPRS, EDGE or EVDO for the cellular backhaul and WiFi for the WLAN.

The following sections pertain only to those systems that transmit/receive sensitive information of security or control data. This shall not be used for the procurement or testing of off-the-shelf devices for routine operations.

Postcontract award, the Vendor shall provide detailed information on communications (including protocols) required for the cellular system to communicate with the control network and the types of network devices with which the cellular system can interface.

The key management protocol uses either EAP [IETF RFC 3748] or X.509 digital certificates [IETF RFC 3280] together with Rivest Shamir Adleman (RSA) public-key encryption algorithm (PKCS 1) or a sequence starting with RSA authentication and followed by EAP authentication.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Procurement Language</Paragraph><Section Style="{DynamicResource SectionBackgroundFlowDocument}"><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide the WiMAX subscriber station equipment and associated documentation.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">Postcontract award, the Vendor shall provide detailed information on communications (including protocols) required for the WiMAX subscriber station to communicate with the base station and the types of network devices with which the wireless device can communicate.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide documentation on the range of the WiMAX subscriber station, power requirements, and the designated frequency of operation for each device.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide, within a prenegotiated period, any test data associated with the WiMAX subscriber station to base station communications.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall clearly identify these security devices and methods to change them from the Vendor-configured or manufacture default conditions.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall remove or disable all software artifacts that are not required for the operation and maintenance of the device prior to the FAT.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall provide the Purchaser SAT procedures that include exercising all functionality and calibration procedures.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall document the equipment configuration and specifically note any security measures associated with the system (encryption devices, password protection, etc.).</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) Measures</Paragraph><Section Style="{DynamicResource SectionBackgroundFlowDocument}"><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The FAT shall be performed per written procedures agreed upon by the Purchaser.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall ensure that the systems have had a minimum of a 48-hour burn-in.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall perform an interference rejection test and supply the results with an explanation of the results.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall ensure that FAT procedures include exercising all functionality and examining the input or output, and validating the results.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Vendor shall verify compatibility of the WiMAX equipment and communications with other devices with which the device must interface.</Paragraph></Section><Paragraph FontWeight="Bold" FontSize="13">Site Acceptance Test (SAT) Measures</Paragraph><Section Style="{DynamicResource SectionBackgroundFlowDocument}"><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Purchaser shall perform the SAT testing per Vendor-supplied procedures.</Paragraph><Paragraph FontStyle="Italic" FontSize="12">The Purchaser shall change any Vendor-configured or manufacturer default usernames, passwords, or other security codes at this time.

INSERT [dbo].[PROCUREMENT_LANGUAGE_DATA] ([Procurement_Id], [Parent_Heading_Id], [Section_Number], [Topic_Name], [Heading], [Basis], [Language_Guidance], [Procurement_Language], [Fatmeasures], [Satmeasures], [Maintenance_Guidance], [References_Doc], [Flow_Document]) VALUES (480, 12, N'13.11', N'Microwave and Satellite Technology', N'Wireless is a technology that should be considered when designing and procuring control systems products. It refers to any technology, such as radio, microwave, or infrared waves, which allows analog and digital communication without the use of wires. Microwave and satellite communications use microwaves for transmitting information from point to point (between two points on the earth or from a point on the earth to a satellite and then back to other points on the earth). ', N'Both microwave and satellite communications use microwaves for transmitting information from point to point, both fixed and mobile. Point-to-point communication is directly between two points on the earth and requires unobstructed LoS. This is typical in a microwave communication link between two cellular network towers. Point-to-multipoint communication provides coverage from a single tower, which may include both LoS and non-LoS paths. Satellite communications transmit from a point on the earth to a satellite and then back to other points on the earth. Satellites introduce some potential latency but can transmit over longer distances and provide connectivity in very remote areas. Microwave communications are preferable because satellite technology is the more expensive technology. Both microwave and satellite transmissions are susceptible to eavesdropping and intrusion techniques by those having the proper knowledge and equipment.

', N'Microwaves are electromagnetic waves in the radio frequencies between about 300 MHz and about 30 GHz with corresponding wavelengths of 1 cm to 1 m. Higher frequency waves have shorter wavelengths. Shorter wavelength transmissions have the advantage of being easier to control. They can be directed by small antennas, which helps keep the energy confined to a tight beam. This beam can be focused on another antenna many miles away. Since the beam is physically narrow, it is more difficult to intercept the signal. Another advantage to microwaves is that greater amounts of information (bandwidth) can be sent because of the high frequency. 

LoS paths are limited in distance by the curvature of the earth, obstacles along the path, and freespace loss. They have a conservative range of 25 to 30 miles but have been effective up to 100 miles. Non-LoS paths are generally used in the lower frequencies (<2 GHz) where refraction, diffraction, and reflection may extend communications coverage beyond LoS distances. The performance of both LoS and non-LoS is affected by free-space path loss, terrain, atmosphere, and precipitation. 

Microwave/satellite communication systems also use oscillators, amplifiers, and antennas as part of the communication system. The oscillator produces the transmission frequency; the amplifiers increase either the transmitted or the received signal, while the antenna, which is normally only 1 foot or a few feet across, provides the means to focus the signal.

Microwave links are very vulnerable to interception during transmission as the signal is sent across free-space line of sight links. Commercial equipment to tap into the signal for this kind of interception is readily and cheaply available. Fixed microwave facilities, such as office buildings, are common targets for this kind of interception as a very small rooftop antenna and decoder near the microwave link are all that is required. Antenna radiation patterns also present the opportunity for monitoring links outside direct LoS due to the presence of signal “sidelobes,” which can be picked up by sensitive receivers in the area. These systems can intercept microwave beams from satellites placed in appropriate positions.

The Vendor shall provide the Purchaser SAT procedures, which include exercising all functionality and calibration procedures.

The Vendor shall document the equipment configuration and specifically note any security measures associated with the system (encryption devices, password protection, etc.). All information carried across the microwave links shall be secured through digital encryption.

', N'The FAT shall be performed per written procedures agreed upon by the Purchaser and in agreement with the requirements of GR-63 NEBS and GR-1089.

For Vendor-supplied microwave device, the Vendor shall install the device and run it continuously during the entire FAT process. 

The Vendor shall ensure that the systems have had a minimum of a 48-hour radio/gear burn-in.

The Vendor shall also apply a bit error test for a minimum of 24 hours and verify that it has the agreed upon level of accuracy. 

The Vendor shall perform an interference rejection test and supply the results with an explanation of the results. 

The Vendor shall ensure that FAT procedures include exercising all functionality and examining the input or output, and validating the results.

The Vendor shall ensure that FAT procedures include written validation and documentation of this requirement.

', N'The Purchaser shall perform the SAT testing per Vendor-supplied procedures.

Any Vendor-configured or manufacturer default usernames, passwords, or other security codes must be changed at this time. The Vendor shall ensure that SAT procedures include written validation and documentation of this requirement.

The SAT shall verify that the installed system meets the specified requirements.

', N'The Vendor shall supply current system configuration to the Purchaser to allow traceability and to ensure no extra services are installed.

The Vendor shall supply written maintenance guidelines for the device, including a timeline, maintenance equipment required, and as-left tolerances. 

The Vendor shall provide upgrades and patches to the microwave device as vulnerabilities are identified in order to maintain the identified level of system security.
