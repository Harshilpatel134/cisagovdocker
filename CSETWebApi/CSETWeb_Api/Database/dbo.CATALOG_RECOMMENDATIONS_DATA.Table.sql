', N'Control system monitoring capability can be achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, log monitoring software, network monitoring software, and network forensic analysis tools). It is paramount that the use of monitoring tools and techniques does not adversely impact the operation performance of the ICS. Monitoring devices can be strategically deployed within the control system (e.g., at selected perimeter locations and/or near server farms supporting critical applications) to collect essential information. Monitoring devices also can be deployed at ad hoc locations within the system to track specific transactions. In addition, these devices can be used to track the impact of security changes to the control system. The granularity of the information collected can be determined by the organization based on its monitoring objectives and the capability of the control system to support such activities. An example of a specific type of transaction of interest to the organization with regard to monitoring is HTTP traffic that bypasses organizational HTTP proxies, when use of such proxies is required. Organizations need to consult with appropriate legal counsel with regard to all system monitoring activities. The level of system monitoring activity is heightened by organizations whenever an indication of increased risk exists to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other credible sources of information.

Requirement Enhancement 1 - The system, for PKI-based authentication:

b. Enforces authorized access to the corresponding private key.
c. Maps the authenticated identity to the user account. Note: Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses.
Requirement Enhancement 2 - The organization requires that the registration process to receive a user authenticator be carried out in person before a designated registration authority with authorization by a designated organizational official (e.g., a supervisor).
Requirement Enhancement 3 - The organization employs automated tools to determine if authenticators are sufficiently strong to resist attacks intended to discover or otherwise compromise the authenticators.
Requirement Enhancement 4 - The organization requires unique authenticators be provided by vendors and manufacturers of system components.', N'Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords. User authenticators include tokens, PKI certificates, biometrics, passwords, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). Many system components are shipped with factory default user authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. However, factory default authentication credentials are often well known, easily discoverable, present a significant security risk, and therefore, are changed upon installation.

The system supports user authenticator management requirements by enforcing organization-defined password minimum and maximum lifetime restrictions and password reuse restrictions for organizationdefined number of generations. Measures to safeguard user authenticators includes maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing authenticators with others, and reporting lost or compromised authenticators immediately.

The audit trail is time correlated if the time stamp in the individual audit records can be reliably related to the time stamp in other audit records to achieve a time ordering of the records within the organization-defined tolerance. In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of automated mechanisms to generate audit records, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls.', N'Audit records can be generated from various components within the system. This control defines the specific system components providing auditing capability. In situations where the ICS cannot support the use of automated mechanisms to generate audit records, the organization employs nonautomated mechanisms or procedures as compensating controls in accordance with the general tailoring guidance.
